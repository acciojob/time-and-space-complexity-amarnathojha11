    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as the input size grows. An algorithm with good time complexity is considered efficient because it completes tasks faster and uses fewer computational resources.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> describes the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. For example, an algorithm with O(n) space complexity requires memory proportional to the input size.
